## there's no place like ~/

### configs in this repo
for general desktop environment stuff
- **[niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri)**, compositor of choice;
- **[hyprlax](https://github.com/sandwichfarm/hyprlax)**, wallpaper
- personal systemd services
-  wireplumber, pipewere, suffering, and my headphones/stereo fallback set-up

for audio (not really)
- **[beegweb_mpris](https://github.com/ther0n/beefweb_mpris)**, allows foobar2000 to publish playback stats via MPRIS
- **[mprisence](https://github.com/lazykern/mprisence/)**, allows discord to snoop on said playback stats
- yes, I use foobar2000 still in wayland. I like my folders->playlist workflow, and [Georgia-ReBORN](github.com/TT-ReBORN/Georgia-ReBORN) is beautiful. Looking forward to [**fooyin**](https://github.com/fooyin/fooyin) though! I believe it's the future. 

### some stuff I use
- **[noctalia shell](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell)**, bar, systray, etc.
- Rikai/DesktopEnv, ""helper""" scripts for the "DE experience"

### WIP
A tree directory of the files will be here soon.  Also, I symlink these folders to my actual `home` folder so, YOLO!
- [ ] **Kvantum**, I've set this up before btw. Lost my progress due to a bricked ssd. It hurts.
- [ ] **dolphinrc**, likewise above :")
- [ ] integration with my other color schemes in general
- [ ] writing my own bar. coming from someone without a lick of JS experience.
